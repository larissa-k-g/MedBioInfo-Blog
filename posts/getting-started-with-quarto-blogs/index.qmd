Second, add your text and adjust the title etc. In short: make your entry.
To check inbetween you can click the preview/rendering button next to the file name or press shift + command + K to get a preview of the updates you made in the webview.
To actually safe and publish go into the Terminal again and 
`$git add --all`
`$git commit -m "Remember to leave a little comment of what the changes that you made were"`
`$git push origin main`
In case of this error: "Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing" try:
`$git pull origin main` This should merge the remote updates with your local copy, then try push again.
`$git push origin main`.
